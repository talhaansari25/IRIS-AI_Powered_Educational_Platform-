        "Hello everyone, welcome back to the computer networks course. Today we will see the classification of computer networks. After completing this session, we will understand what are LAN, MAN and WAN. And after understanding LAN, WAN and MAN, we will also understand what are the devices that are involved in LAN, MAN and WAN. And we will also understand what are the new trends in computer network. We will see the classification of computer networks. Computer networks are classified into Local Area Network or simply LAN, Metropolitan Area Network or simply MAN, Wide Area Network or simply WAN. We will see Local Area Network first. As the name implies, Local means it is restricted to a limited area. That is, a small network is said to be a local area network. A Local Area Network is a computer network that interconnects computers within a limited area. Say a small network that is there in our residence, or a school, lab, university campus or office is said to be a Local Area Network. Let's take an example. Let there be hundred computers in a network. And this is a school network. Each of these computers are connected to each other with the help of a switch. And we can call this computer network as a Local Area Network. Why because, all these computers can communicate with each other internally. We can setup LAN in two ways: one is a wired LAN and another one is a wireless LAN. In wired LAN we have cables. So the example technology for a wired LAN is ethernet. We have already seen in the previous lecture that, ethernet is used to connect two or more nodes. In this case, this node is connected to the switch, this computer is connected to the switch with the help of an ethernet cable. To be precise, this is an ethernet straight-through cable because ethernet straight through cable connects devices of different kinds. Switch and computers are different kinds of devices. So we need to use ethernet straight-through cable. In case, if we want to connect this computer with this computer directly, then we have to go for ethernet crossover cable. Whatever it is, ethernet is the well known and the most popular technology in wired LAN. And the devices that are used in the wired LAN are hub and switch. I will talk about this hub and switch in the next lecture elaborately. Now you just understand hub or switch can be an intermediary device in a local area network. And that too in a wired local area network. We can also have a wireless local area network. Example: Wi-Fi. Now we will see metropolitan area network or simply MAN. A metropolitan area network is a computer network that interconnects users or computers in a geographic region. Say there are two branches in a city and these two branches are somehow connected with each other. So this kind of network is called as a metropolitan area network. In other words there are two local area networks, these two local area networks are connected to each other in a city. The devices involved in this metropolitan area network are switches/hubs for establishing a local area network and to connect two local area networks we need routers or bridges. As I already mentioned there are minimum two local area network and these two local area networks are to be connected with each other with the help of a router or a bridge. We will see an example now. There are four local area networks connected to each other. Let's take this is a supermarket and this supermarket has four branches. Computers in one supermarket will be in one local area network. Similarly other branches also have separate local area network. And these supermarket branches must somehow communicate with each other. For example, if someone is asking for a product which is not there in this branch, the employee of this branch wants to search whether the product is available in other branches. This is possible only if all local area networks of the supermarket are connected. And this is what is exactly a metropolitan area network. Please remember this is restricted to only a small geographic region like a city. Please note in every LAN there are some computers and these computers can communicate with other computers in other local area network. And this is possible only if these computers are somehow connected with each other. It is time to see wide area network that is the WAN A wide area network is a telecommunications network that extends over a large geographical area. It means, it is a telecommunications network but it deals with the larger geographical area. First we will see what is a telecommunications network. Any communication at a distance, we call it as a telecommunication network. So here, the communication is going to be within a large geographical area. In MAN, two or more LAN's within a city can communicate with each other. In WAN, two or more LAN's within a country can communicate with each other. The devices in WAN are-- all end devices and intermediary devices. Because an end device in one part of the country, may want to communicate with an end device which is in the other part of the country. And some authors will refer to this wide area network to be the internet. We will see an example now. There are two local area networks, one local area network is in New Delhi and other local area network is in Chennai. And these two local area network are in two different places in the country. And they are separated by a very large geographical area. But still, this computer can communicate with this computer. And this is possible only with the help of a wide area network. Wide area network means communication at a large distance. If it is a MAN, this is possible only within a city but this is wide area network, hence the communication at a distance is still possible. So far we have seen local area network, metropolitan area network and wide area network. Now we will see the Internet. I will say this is a wide wide area network i.e. a wide WAN. Why because, there are so many local area networks, so many metropolitan area networks and so many wide area networks, across the world are connected to each other. Say for example there is a guy in India who wants to send some data to a guy who is in Australia. Between India and Australia, there are many routers involved in taking the data from India to Australia. Similarly, every country in the world is somehow connected with other countries through computer network. We don't know whether two country have a friendly relationship or not. But definitely they will have a computer network relationship. And that's the power of computer network guys. Before we conclude, we will see the new trends in computer networks. Nowadays, many employees are encouraged by their employers to bring their own device and connect to the office network. And we shall call such scenario as a bring your own device scenario. It means employees can bring their own device and connect it to their office network and still work with the office network. Coming to the online collaboration, once upon a time if a meeting is scheduled, everyone has to assemble in the meeting spot. Now the trend has completely been changed. They can participate from wherever they are and they can still do online collaboration with others with the help of computer network. Say for example, a meeting involves participants in New Delhi, Chennai, America, Australia but still no one to be there in a particular or a specific location. They can be wherever they are, but still they can do online collaboration. And cloud computing is the new trend that we would like to address. Cloud computing means it is the on-demand availability of computer resources. First let's take an example, let's take Google Drive. One can store all files and folders in Google Drive that gives a lot of flexibility. If one wants to access his files from any part of the world, he can access by just giving a request to Google Drive and download the data. What if he had stored the data in his personal computer? He needs to carry the computer wherever he goes if he wants the data with him. But cloud computing, say this Google drive offers this on-demand availability. Cloud computing is the on-demand availability of computer resources, especially data storage and this computing. We need not directly involve in the management. We can just store the data somewhere in a secured manner and get the data whenever we want it. That is the power of cloud computing. That's it guys. In the initial part of this session, we have listed that we are going to learn certain things. Now we will ensure whether we have learnt all these things. I hope now you have learnt what is local area network, metropolitan area network and wide area network and we have also seen what are the various devices involved in LAN, MAN and WAN. And there are some new trends that are there in the computer networking field and we have also seen those trends. Thank you for watching. Hello everyone, welcome back to the computer networks course.

      "caption":
        "hey guys welcome in today's digital world data is more valuable than ever before data is the key to the smooth functioning of everything from a government to a local company the success of a company vastly depends on how well they utilize their data this is where database comes into picture you need a database to store data in this video let's learn what is database and the different types of database available today but before we talk about database it's important to understand data data data can be anything and everything any information or fact can be considered as data your name age date of birth or any other information such as your house address your bank balance the vehicle you drive or even the food that you eat can be considered as data details related to a school or a technology or statistics or even mathematics can be considered as data and can be stored into a database data can be in any form such as an image or a video or a file or even a plain text data in any of this format can be stored into a database for a school data can be detailed related to its teachers or its students or the subjects they teach all of these can be data as you can see data can be anything and everything and data can be in any form now that you know what data is it's time to understand where do we store them and the purpose of storing them what is database database can be considered as a container filled with data or information which is electronically stored in a computer system data in any form can be stored into the database the purpose of storing the data into the database is so it can be easily accessed modified protected and analyzed you may already be using database in your day-to-day activities because most of the websites or mobile applications today such as google instagram whatsapp facebook already used database to store data as an example let's say for your college demo project you plan to develop a simple college timesheet web application basically this application should allow you to login through a url and then have options to enter staff details timesheet details student attendance student marks etc since this is a college demo project you may just use your personal computer to develop this project the first thing your application will need is a database to store and retrieve the data hence you need to first install a database on your laptop which will connect to this timesheet application like any other software installed on your computer database software will also be allocated to a specific location in your computer hard drive through your web application whenever you try to save edit or retrieve information the application will actually connect to the database to store modify or extract the data in other words any information that is shown in your application is actually being retrieved from the database and any information you enter in the application will actually be stored into the database but since the database is installed on your computer the data is actually being stored into your computer memory this is a simple example of how an application uses a small database to store modify and retrieve data when it comes to bigger applications or bigger companies they need huge database to store huge data which may be installed on large servers this is true to any application that uses a database the images videos or posts or any other information that you see on facebook is actually stored in a database and whenever you search for a specific post or friend facebook actually searches for this data in its database so is database same as dbms lot of people referred to database as dbms but that's not entirely correct because database is just a container that stores data whereas dbms or database management system is a software which is used to manage your database you need dpms to interact with the database to store modify retrieve and protect data dbms is also required to create modify and delete database users like you and me can use dbms to enter commands in a specific language to interact with the database examples of dbms can be mysql postgresql mongodb neo4j cassandra etc evolution of database started in 1960s when the first type of database were made which was the flight file database here the data was stored in simple files such as csv file or fixed length file etc later on came the hierarchical database and then the network database both of this database stored data through parent-child relationship but both of these databases were incapable of storing complex data relationships hence were soon replaced by relational database fast forward to 2020 in today's world there are mainly two popular database types relational database and non-relational database as per the usage over 74 percent of the database used today are relational database but due to the immense rising data usage over the past decade mainly due to social media platforms non-relational database have become very popular however the biggest companies today who store data related to millions of users every day generally use combination of both relational and non-relational database hence both these database types are very popular and widely used oracle is the most widely used relational database whereas mongodb is the most widely used non-relational database let's briefly look at each of these database types relational database in a relational database data is stored through collection of tables these tables are related to one another each table consists of columns and rows each column has a name and a data type data type can be said as a data rule which is associated to every column only those data that satisfy this data rule can be inserted in the specific column a row can be treated as a record which is formed by single or multiple columns [Music] as an example if we consider an office database it will have information related to employees managers and departments these details are stored in different tables but these tables will be related to each other through certain columns here employee and manager table is related through the manager id column which is present in both these tables in a relational database foreign key constraint is used to form relation between different tables similarly manager and department tables are related through the department id column as you can see employee and the department table are not directly related to each other but still it is possible to fetch data from the employee table based on specific conditions from the department table this is how relational database works information is scattered across multiple tables which are related to one another hence using table relations it is possible to retrieve data from different tables in a relational database using dbms you can enter commands in specific language to store retrieve and modify data this specific language is sql or structured query language sql is a programming language which follows a standard format for querying data across different relational database most of the financial institutions such as bank or insurance companies use relational database examples of relational database are oracle mysql microsoft sql server postgresql etc non-relational database when it comes to a non-relational database there are several categories of database such as key value store document database graph database wide column database search engine database time series database etc each of these database store data differently and are useful for managing specific types of data let's briefly look at a few of them key value database also called as key value store it is the simplest of the non-relational database and as the name suggests every data stored in this database will be assigned to a key to store data you provide a key and a blob of data such as an image text file json object etc once saved to retrieve the data just provide the key [Music] key value database are very useful to store certain types of data such as configuration data state information or any data that might be represented by a dictionary or a hash in a programming language examples can be redis database memcache database etc document database also called as document store these are these also use unique key to identify data stored in database however unlike key value store document database store data in structured format called documents often using json vsan or xml format though each document within this database has structured data there is no specific format to be followed for all documents each document can have its own structure which the database understands so unlike key value store the data stored in document database can be queried and analyzed examples can be mongodb couchdb etc graph database graph database falls under the bracket of non-relational database and follows a different approach to forming relationships between data rather than using tables and foreign keys to form relation graph database forms relation by using nodes edges and properties data is represented through individual nodes and each node can have multiple properties between these nodes edges or relationships are established to represent different types of connections hence in a graph database data is stored as node and relationships are represented through edges if you are working with data where relationships or connections between data are most important then graph database is the right choice graph database is useful when searching for specific pattern like fraud detection through money laundering transactions etc example can be neo4j database white column database also known as column family database white column database store data using rows and columns but they do not use tables instead of tables they use structure called as column families column families contain rows of data where each row has its own structure or schema each row comprises of unique row identifier and sets of column names and values each row can have different number of columns with different types of data examples can be cassandra edge base etc you",

      "name": "Fundamental Concepts of Object Oriented Programming",
      "caption":
        "the four fundamental concepts of object-oriented programming are abstraction encapsulation inheritance and polymorphism before considering what they mean first consider what is an object an object is a thing from the real world it could be a car a boat or a book but it might not be something physical that you can touch it could be a dental appointment a seat reservation for the cinema or a bank account in the realm of object object-oriented programming an object is anything of interest to the software application that you're building it's anything that you want to store and process data about another name for an object is an entity this leads us to the first fundamental concept of object-oriented programming namely abstraction abstraction means to simplify reality for example a person is an object but if you were designing a new application to process data about a person it's unlikely that you'd be interested in everything there is to know about a person rather you would only concern yourself with the data that are relevant and the tasks that you want to perform with those data to create objects programmatically you need a class a class is a template for creating objects a class is code written by a programmer to define the attributes and the operations of an object attributes describe the object they're sometimes referred to as fields because they contain data most programmers know them as properties properties are coded within the class either as public variables or as property procedures operations are actions that can be done to or performed by the object they're sometimes referred to as behaviors but more commonly they're known as methods methods are programs within the class that are coded either as procedures or functions a class is a template for creating objects and it's often compared with a pastry cutter because once it's been written it can be used to create many objects of the same type in fact a class is sometimes referred to as a type each object is an instance of a class in the computer's memory creating an object from a class is therefore known as instantiation once these objects have been created their properties can be assigned values making each object of the same type a unique entity each property is defined in the class by a property procedure which may include code to validate a property value while it's being assigned this helps to ensure the integrity of the data contained within the object the property values that have been assigned to an object are collectively known as the state of the object it's also possible to assign values to properties while an object is being instantiated by means of a special method called new this method is known as the constructor the second fundamental concept of object-oriented programming is encapsulation this means to hide the complexity of the inner workings of an object from the programs and the programmers that make use of it it's often referred to as information hiding because the data contained within an object and the functions that manipulate the data are bound together and therefore safe from outside interference in some big software development projects it's common for more experienced programmers to write the classes that will be used by the junior programmers a class might be made available in the form of a class library indeed some software development companies specialise in developing new classes to be used by other software developers compiled class libraries protect their intellectual property to write code that will create an object from a class then set its properties and call its methods it's not necessary to understand the inner workings of the class all the programmer needs to know is the name of the class the properties and methods available and any data that need to be supplied when they're called in other words all our programmer really needs to know about is the interface of the class the implementation code of those properties and methods can remain a mystery this greatly simplifies the use of objects and helps to ensure that the data and operations encapsulated within are safe the third fundamental concept of object-oriented programming is inheritance this means that a class can derive its methods and properties from another class inheritance can result in a hierarchy of classes for example this person class defines the methods and properties of a person object an employee in a business is also a person so through inheritance an employee class derives the methods and properties of the person class an employee is a type of person a customer of the business is also a person so through inheritance a customer class also derives the methods and properties of the person class a customer is a type of person an employee class can have some extra properties and methods of its own it can extend the person class and so can a customer but it need not stop there a programmer is a type of employee and so is a manager and a cleaner inheritance defines type of relationships the class at the start of the inheritance hierarchy is called the base class any class that derives from another class is called a sub class any class that is derived from is called a superclass the final fundamental concept of object-oriented programming is polymorphism polymorphism means that a class can implement an inherited method in its own way the person class at the base of this hierarchy has a method which will save details of any object created from the person class perhaps to a database thanks to inheritance all of the classes in this hierarchy do exactly the same thing but it may be necessary for a customer's details to be saved differently perhaps to a different database polymorphism allows for this the customer class can override the workings of any method or property that it inherits with a new version of its own different forms of the same type of object with the same interface can behave in different ways polymorphism literally means many forms to recap the fundamental concepts of object-oriented programming abstraction means to simplify reality and focus only on the data and processes that are relevant to the application being built encapsulation means that data and the programs that manipulate those data are bound together and their complexity is hidden inheritance means that a class can derive its methods and properties from another class this might result in an extensive hierarchy of superclasses and subclasses polymorphism means that different subclasses of the same superclass which therefore share the same interface can implement those interfaces in their own ways by overriding the code of the methods they inherit",

      "caption":
        "imagine you're the owner of a small software development firm and you want to scale your business up however a small team size the unpredictability of demand and limited resources are roadblocks for this expansion that's when you hear about cloud computing but before investing money into it you decide to draw up the differences between on-premise and cloud-based computing to make a better decision when it comes to scalability you pay more for an on-premise setup and get lesser options too once you've scaled up it is difficult to scale down and often leads to heavy losses in terms of infrastructure and maintenance costs cloud computing on the other hand allows you to pay only for how much you use with much easier and faster provisions for scaling up or down next let's talk about server storage on-premise systems need a lot of space for their servers notwithstanding the power and maintenance hassles that come with them on the other hand cloud computing solutions are offered by cloud service providers who manage and maintain the servers saving you both money and space then we have data security on-premise systems offer less data security thanks to a complicated combination of physical and traditional i.t security measures whereas cloud computing systems offer much better security and lets you avoid having to constantly monitor and manage security protocols in the event that a data loss does occur the chance for data recovery with on-premise setups are very small in contrast cloud computing systems have robust disaster recovery measures in place to ensure faster and easier data recovery finally we have maintenance on-premises systems also require additional teams for hardware and software maintenance loading up the costs by a considerable degree cloud computing systems on the other hand are maintained by the cloud service providers reducing your costs and resource allocation substantially so now thinking that cloud computing is a better option you decide to take a closer look at what exactly cloud computing is cloud computing refers to the delivery of on-demand computing services over the internet on a pay-as-you-go basis in simpler words rather than managing files and services on a local storage device you'll be doing the same over the internet in a cost efficient manner cloud computing has two types of models deployment model and service model there are three types of deployment models public private and hybrid cloud imagine you're traveling to work you've got three options to choose from one you have buses which represent public clouds in this case the cloud infrastructure is available to the public over the internet these are owned by cloud service providers two then you have the option of using your own car this represents the private cloud with the private cloud the cloud infrastructure is exclusively operated by a single organization this can be managed by the organization or a third party and finally you have the option to hail a cab this represents the hybrid cloud a hybrid cloud is a combination of the functionalities of both public and private clouds next let's have a look at the service models there are three major service models available es pass and sas compared to on-premise models where you'll need to manage and maintain every component including applications data virtualization and middleware cloud computing service models are hassle-free is refers to infrastructure as a service it is a cloud service model where users get access to basic computing infrastructure they are commonly used by it administrators if your organization requires resources like storage or virtual machines is is the model for you you only have to manage the data runtime middleware applications and the os while the rest is handled by the cloud providers next we have pass pass or platform as a service provides cloud platforms and runtime environments for developing testing and managing applications this service model enables users to deploy applications without the need to acquire manage and maintain the related architecture if your organization is in need of a platform for creating software applications pass is the model for you pass only requires you to handle the applications and the data the rest of the components like runtime middleware operating systems servers storage and others are handled by the cloud service providers and finally we have sas sas or software as a service involves cloud services for hosting and managing your software applications software and hardware requirements are satisfied by the vendors so you don't have to manage any of those aspects of the solution if you'd rather not worry about the hassles of owning any it equipment the sas model would be the one to go with with sas the cloud service provider handles all components of the solution required by the organization time for a quiz now in which of the following deployment models are you as the business responsible for the application data and operating system one is two pass three sas four is and pass let us know your answer in the comments section below for a chance to win an amazon voucher coming back to cloud computing some of the most popular cloud computing services in the market are aws or amazon web services microsoft azure and google cloud platform want to learn more about them and how they differ from each other click on the top right corner for an analysis of how these service platforms are different from each other and on that note we have come to the end of this

        "we know humans learn from their past experiences and machines follow instructions given by humans but what if humans can train the machines to learn from the past data and do what humans can do and much faster well that's called machine learning but it's a lot more than just learning it's also about understanding and reasoning so today we will learn about the basics of machine learning so that's paul he loves listening to new songs he either likes them or dislikes them paul decides this on the basis of the song's tempo genre intensity and the gender of voice for simplicity let's just use tempo and intensity for now so here tempo is on the x axis ranging from relaxed to fast whereas intensity is on the y axis ranging from light to soaring we see that paul likes the song with fast tempo and soaring intensity while he dislikes the song with relaxed tempo and light intensity so now we know paul's choices let's say paul listens to a new song let's name it as song a song a has fast tempo and a soaring intensity so it lies somewhere here looking at the data can you guess whether paul will like the song or not correct so paul likes this song by looking at paul's past choices we were able to classify the unknown song very easily right let's say now paul listens to a new song let's label it as song b so song b lies somewhere here with medium tempo and medium intensity neither relaxed nor fast neither light nor soaring now can you guess whether paul likes it or not not able to guess whether paul will like it or dislike it are the choices unclear correct we could easily classify song a but when the choice became complicated as in the case of song b yes and that's where machine learning comes in let's see how in the same example for song b if we draw a circle around the song b we see that there are four votes for like whereas one would for dislike if we go for the majority votes we can say that paul will definitely like the song that's all this was a basic machine learning algorithm also it's called k nearest neighbors so this is just a small example in one of the many machine learning algorithms quite easy right believe me it is but what happens when the choices become complicated as in the case of song b that's when machine learning comes in it learns the data builds the prediction model and when the new data point comes in it can easily predict for it more the data better the model higher will be the accuracy there are many ways in which the machine learns it could be either supervised learning unsupervised learning or reinforcement learning let's first quickly understand supervised learning suppose your friend gives you one million coins of three different currencies say one rupee one euro and one dirham each coin has different weights for example a coin of one rupee weighs three grams one euro weighs seven grams and one dirham weighs four grams your model will predict the currency of the coin here your weight becomes the feature of coins while currency becomes the label when you feed this data to the machine learning model it learns which feature is associated with which label for example it will learn that if a coin is of 3 grams it will be a 1 rupee coin let's give a new coin to the machine on the basis of the weight of the new coin your model will predict the currency hence supervised learning uses labeled data to train the model here the machine knew the features of the object and also the labels associated with those features on this note let's move to unsupervised learning and see the difference suppose you have cricket data set of various players with their respective scores and wickets taken when you feed this data set to the machine the machine identifies the pattern of player performance so it plots this data with the respective wickets on the x-axis while runs on the y-axis while looking at the data you'll clearly see that there are two clusters the one cluster are the players who scored higher runs and took less wickets while the other cluster is of the players who scored less runs but took many wickets so here we interpret these two clusters as batsmen and bowlers the important point to note here is that there were no labels of batsmen and bowlers hence the learning with unlabeled data is unsupervised learning so we saw supervised learning where the data was labeled and the unsupervised learning where the data was unlabeled and then there is reinforcement learning which is a reward based learning or we can say that it works on the principle of feedback here let's say you provide the system with an image of a dog and ask it to identify it the system identifies it as a cat so you give a negative feedback to the machine saying that it's a dog's image the machine will learn from the feedback and finally if it comes across any other image of a dog it will be able to classify it correctly that is reinforcement learning to generalize machine learning model let's see a flowchart input is given to a machine learning model which then gives the output according to the algorithm applied if it's right we take the output as a final result else we provide feedback to the training model and ask it to predict until it learns i hope you've understood supervised and unsupervised learning so let's have a quick quiz you have to determine whether the given scenarios uses supervised or unsupervised learning simple right scenario one facebook recognizes your friend in a picture from an album of tagged photographs scenario 2 netflix recommends new movies based on someone's past movie choices scenario 3 analyzing bank data for suspicious transactions and flagging the fraud transactions think wisely and comment below your answers moving on don't you sometimes wonder how is machine learning possible in today's era well that's because today we have humongous data available everybody is online either making a transaction or just surfing the internet and that's generating a huge amount of data every minute and that data my friend is the key to analysis also the memory handling capabilities of computers have largely increased which helps them to process such huge amount of data at hand without any delay and yes computers now have great computational powers so there are a lot of applications of machine learning out there to name a few machine learning is used in healthcare where diagnostics are predicted for doctor's review the sentiment analysis that the tech giants are doing on social media is another interesting application of machine learning fraud detection in the finance sector and also to predict customer churn in the e-commerce sector while booking a gap you must have encountered surge pricing often where it says the fair of your trip has been updated continue booking yes please i'm getting late for office well that's an interesting machine learning model which is used by global taxi giant uber and others where they have differential pricing in real time based on demand the number of cars available bad weather rush r etc so they use the surge pricing model to ensure that those who need a cab can get one also it uses predictive modeling to predict where the demand will be high with the goal that drivers can take care of the demand and search pricing can be minimized great hey siri can you remind me to book a cab at 6 pm today ok i'll remind you thanks no problem comment below some interesting everyday examples around you where machines are learning and doing amazing jobs so that's all for machine learning basics today from my site keep watching this space for more interesting videos until then happy learning",

      "name": "Fluid Mechanics : Introduction",
      "caption":
        "Welcome to the fluid mechanics lesson series my name is john zimbala and this is the first lesson in the series lesson 1a introduction in this lesson we'll define fluid mechanics by first defining a fluid and then defining mechanics we'll also discuss normal stresses and shear stresses so what is fluid mechanics it's composed of two words fluid and mechanics so we'll first define a fluid common definition is that a fluid is a liquid or a gas if you think about the three common states of matter solid liquid and gas these two are fluids it turns out that we can often treat these two the same liquids and gases here's the caveat to that if compressibility effects are negligible and there's no free surfaces we mean for example water surface exposed to air then liquids and gases behave the same so we can analyze just a fluid without worrying about whether it's a gas or a liquid liquids and gases behave pretty much the same here's some quick examples some students at penn state built a human powered submarine but we tested it in my wind tunnel another example i was studying some jet engine exhaust for research project and i tested it in a water tunnel so if we compare the actual fluid and the test fluid the actual fluid here was water but the test fluid was air in this case the actual fluid was air and the tested fluid was water it's just a matter of convenience in water it's easier to visualize in an air it's easier to measure as i mentioned up here these are the exceptions liquids with the free surface and gases in high speed flow for free surface effects this would for example be waves generated by a boat on the surface of a lake gases in high speed flow would be for example rockets where compressibility effects are significant you can't model this case with air and you can't model this case with water here's a formal definition of a fluid a fluid is a substance that deforms continuously under the application of a shear stress well we can't understand that unless we know what a stress is in particular what a shear stress is here's a definition of stress stress is a force per unit area acting on a surface we have both normal stresses and shear stresses let's look at a solid object and a liquid of course the liquid has to be in a container of some kind in both cases we add a normal stress a normal stress by its definition is normal in other words 90 degrees to the surface on which it acts what happens when we add a normal stress on this solid in other words we just push down on it well the solid will deform probably something like this it'll bulge out and it'll press down a little bit and then it sits still under this new condition we can also add a normal stress to the liquid by imagining a piston on the surface of the liquid and we push down on it assuming this is a rigid container liquid can't bulge out but it can compress a little liquids are approximately incompressible meaning that they don't compress very much in fact we'll assume that liquids are incompressible in this course we can write this statement a solid can resist a normal stress it deforms but it resists that normal stress for the liquid we have to add the caveat a liquid at rest can resist a normal stress so both a solid and a liquid at rest can resist a normal stress pressure is the most common example of a normal stress in fact in a fluid at rest the only normal stress is the pressure stress and pressure always acts inward and normal to a surface for example if you have a solid object like this the pressure acts always inward and normal always acts towards the surface and normal to the surface this is the case of an actual surface like a potato the same thing applies however to an imaginary surface if we have a fluid particle the same shape as this potato but it's in air we can draw an imaginary surface around that object this fluid particle the pressure will still act normal and inward we can call this a fluid particle which is just a chunk of fluid with imaginary boundaries well these are normal stresses what about shear stresses let's do the same kind of comparison between the solid and the liquid a shear stress is a tangential stress on a surface so if we apply a tangential stress a shear stress on the solid assuming this part is anchored to the ground it will distort somewhat i'm exaggerating here it will distort something like this and as long as we keep applying that stress it'll just sit there in this new configuration so we say that a solid can resist a shear stress what happens if we try the same thing on a liquid we apply a shear stress at this free surface of the liquid again the container can't distort but the liquid will start moving in fact it'll set up some kind of a recirculating pattern so it sets up a flow internally in this container in other words fluid cannot resist shear stress it deforms continuously when you apply a shear stress and deforming continuously means that it sets up some kind of a flow so to make this more correct we need to say a fluid at rest cannot resist the shear stress and that's the bottom line of what we wrote here fluid at rest cannot resist a shear stress instead it will deform and flow in contrast the fluid in motion can have both the shear stress and a normal stress let's look at our solid and our liquid again when we apply a shear stress to the solid there will be stresses on this little element of the solid let's examine all the stresses on this solid element and on the liquid element using a free body diagram let's magnify the element since this solid has distorted there are shear stresses and normal stresses on it the shear stress on this element will look like that and there will be another one on the bottom that's equal and opposite to keep this thing from spinning infinitely around it has to have balancing stresses on the sides there will also be a normal stress in this case at the top and bottom perhaps a little bit on the sides and there also will be a weight w acting down by the way this is called a body force and these are called surface forces i'll also draw the normal stresses on the sides of this element since this solid is at rest newton's first law tells us that sigma f must equal zero this is statics now consider the liquid first let's add a normal stress since this liquid is at rest it cannot resist a shear stress but it can resist a normal stress so we expect there to be normal stresses like this but no shear stresses there also will be a weight associated with this little element due to gravity we'll get into this later with hydrostatics but the pressure at the bottom has to be bigger than the pressure at the top in order for this thing to stay still again this is statics so sigma f has to equal 0. since this liquid element is at rest only normal stresses are possible as we have drawn now let's look at this liquid with shear added i'll resketch this now suppose all we do is add our shear stress at the surface now our fluid particle will not stay still it will move and our free body diagram has to have both normal stresses and shear stresses as well as weight but in this case the fluid particle is not just sitting still but it's moving in fact if it's moving in some kind of curved path it has to have acceleration so our equation now is sigma f equal ma newton's second law since the fluid particle is accelerating there's a further complication with fluids compared to solids and that is that as this fluid particle moves it also distorts as sketched here it doesn't remain a rectangle but it changes to some other shape and as it keeps moving it will keep distorting to some new shape now to make this a little more realistic if this is an incompressible fluid the area in all three of these must be the same since it's not compressing if you had a compressible gas not only will it change shape but it can also compress and get smaller or decompress and get larger in both cases they distort finally let's return to our definition of fluid mechanics we defined fluid now we have to define mechanics so what is mechanics the dictionary says mechanics is the application of the laws of force and motion and then it goes on to say there are two branches statics and dynamics so in this course we'll study both fluid statics which is also called hydrostatics and this is the study of fluids at rest we'll make use of free body diagrams as we did above when everything is at rest we have sigma f equals zero fluid dynamics is the study of fluids in motion fluid mechanics is both or either fluid statics or fluid dynamics when you have fluid dynamics fluids in motion then you have acceleration and we must use sigma f equal ma instead of zero so finally combining these two definitions fluid mechanics is the application of the laws of force and motion on a fluid which is a substance that deforms continuously under the application of a shear stress and the two branches are fluid statics and fluid dynamics",

        "hello friends welcome to the course on structural analysis and in this section we will learn what is a structural analysis and why we need to do the structural analysis [Music] before moving into the course the first thing that we need to understand is what is structural analysis so what is structural analysis so what actually is this thing let us say that you want to build a post so you want to build a vertical post so that he can rest or you can put a spare they say a football the size is fair you know it's a heavy sphere not just a football so football sized is fair on the top of this post a maybe for the decorative purpose so now you know how big you want this pair and you know the weight of this pair now you have to determine the size of this post and let us say that you want this post of all concrete so this is a concrete post okay so this is the section so if I just cut this section over here so this is the section of this post so what happens is that if your post is very small so let us say that you make a small thin post just like this okay let's say it's a five centimeter by five centimeter post a very small post right so the post will look like this okay so it will look like this and you want to put a ball over here so if this section so this section over here that is this section is very small in that case what will happen is that if this is fair is quite big let's say that the weight of this pair is around 300 kilo Newton in that case this small size post will not be able to sustain the load of this pair and it will collapse okay so you cannot use a small sized section of the post what if you use the big size post let's say that the post is now of 50 cm by 50 cm so now the post is quite big like this right and now you can simply put this fare on the top of this the spare is quite small as compared to the section or let us say the surface of this post and it will easily take the load of this is fair though this post can easily hold this pair in position but constructing this pair is quite an economical tonic nautical means that it will be more costly to build this post as a person who is spending money on building something you don't want the economical sections and also you don't want small sections that will collapse when the load is exerted on those structures so as an engineer what now you need to do is that so what you now need to do is that you need to find the exact size of this post so yeah you have to find the exact size so let's say that this height is fixed okay let's say it's like 4 meter height and you can only change the length this length let us say this is length and this breadth of this post right so you cannot change other things so now you have to find the length of this post and you have to find the breadth the exact breadth that will be just sufficient to take this load this 300 kilo Newton load off is fair so you cannot make a small section because it will collapse you cannot make big section means that you cannot have higher values of L and B because it will be on economical so you need to have those values of an lnb which will just be sufficient to take this is fair this process of finding the exact size of length and breadth is known as structural design hold on it is not known as the stock so analysis it is known as the structural design so why I am talking about structural design because stock swirl design is related to structural analysis and we do structural analysis in order to do the structural design so now where does the structural analysis comes into play okay so in order to find the exact size of this post that is the exact length and the exact breadth as an engineer what you have to do is that we have to assume that when this pair is placed on the top of this post that is this 300 kilo Newton load is applied on the top of the post in that situation what will be the internal load that will that will exert in this post so we know that according to Newton's third law of motion so whenever there is certain force on our body okay the body will exert the reaction values so you have to find the reaction values R that is generated in this body so in this post you can say that now let's suppose that you found this R value so you know this 300 kilo Newton value right so you know the external load is now using the principles of stocks and analysis you found this R value now you now you have to find the size so that will take this R value so you have to find this section you have to find the length you have to find the breadth that will be able to take this load okay so there are certain principles certain procedures which you can use in order to check whether or not your section which means that whether or not the values of L and B will be able to take this reaction values the reaction force value will be able to endure this reaction value okay so this reaction force R is known as the internal force internal force and you can see that this the load of this pair is the external force and this reaction force is the internal force the process of finding out this internal force R is known as structural analysis so it structural analysis is the process of the process of determining internal reaction so it's now the force sorry it's the reaction internal reaction of our structure they say of a structural member is known as so he's known as structural analysis okay so it's different mind not it's determining the remaining internal reaction of a structural member is known as structural analysis so why we need to do the structural analysis so I have already said that earlier we need to do the instruction analysis because based on this structural analysis so based on this reaction value we will find the length and we'll find the breadth or you can say we we will find the section that will take that load and this process is known as the structural design so as an engineer or ultimate goal is never the stops analysis or ultimate goal is the structural design in this course we will learn how to do the structural analysis and will not learn how to do the structural design so this course will be specifically a concerned with the structure analysis [Music] you [Music]",

soil and what actual bearing failure actually means in different soil types so i've got a practical example here we're about to demonstrate an actual bearing failure in a sandy material so what are the different types of soils well here have rock which is a hard material or you have cohesive or non-cohesive soils so non-cocaine soils is similar to the sand as you can see it doesn't really join together and just forms individual grains as opposed to a clay we can make it more like a play-doh so it can turn into a ball and actually sticks together these three types of founding materials behave very differently in a bearing failure well a rock is more like one of those ones that are going to fracture or crush more like you would see a failure in such materials such as concrete and how about a sand we'll start off with this practical example of what a bearing valley is going to look like under a sandy material so we'll get the pressure going and push it down you'll see the soil around it start to heave up and move around you can see it builds up around the sides as this moves into the ground so what is happening here as the load increases and you start to see a bearing failure the object sinks into the soil essentially displacing the soil causing that heaving around the outside so let's reset this and see what's actually happening so as the load increases you start to see settlement and heaving around the outside as a series of shear planes start to build up in the soil these shear planes are amount of soil that is getting displaced as the object is sunk into the ground so depending on how much load is around it is how much sediment and the angle of those shear planes if you've enjoyed this practical demonstration of bearing failure don't forget to bear down on that like button not only does it help me out but also gets it out to more engineers now let's keep learning about the different bearing valleys and footing systems that you have in your structural designs a clay or cohesive soil will behave differently to sand so as the load increases it slowly compresses the clay and seeps out any water that's trapped inside the pores and as that water slowly seeps out this building slowly settles into the soil and over time that clay or cohesive soil increases with strength so you get a slightly different value mechanism so the building over time is increasing it's bearing capacity as it's slowly settling into the soil when we're doing our bearing design of our footings it's about the level of acceptable settlement over time that the structure can handle so it's more like a serviceability check that we do for deflecting beams as any pressure that is applied to the soil will cause some level of displacement to resist those actions so what type of footing systems do you have in your disposal to resist these actions well the first one the most common one is a pad footing the pad footing has a single isolated point load from above that's pressing down and it's a big enough size to resist the actions from that point load so you have an acceptable level of settlement or if you've got a big long wall generally under those walls you'll have a thing called the strip footing essentially it's just a big beam in the ground and they can be also spread the low down so that line load is not too much pressure on the soil or if you've got a big core so you've got a series of walls coming down you might have a big wrap that will do a series of things it personally helps distribute that force over an area but also helps having a corrective action so when the core tries to rotate it's a big enough size to help resist those overturning moments that are happening in your pool so another really common system is a pile now a pile is slightly different to our pad footing which is just relying on the bearing actions so a pile is an action of both its bearing at the end and the skin friction on the side of it it helps resist the actions from the loaders above and of course the deeper you do all those piles the more bearing capacity you have around it and the more confinement pressure so the more skin friction you'll get this also acts in reverse so for example if you have big overturning moments that you need to resist those tension forces that skin friction helps pull up some of the soil around it essentially pulling a cone of soil out to help tie down your building so another footing system similar to a pile is a screw pile now screw pile has a little propeller on the end of it and they screw it into the soil and what that allows you to do is work out what is the actual bearing pressure you're achieving from it by how much effort you need to screw that into the soil it also provides that uplift capacity as well but a good thing about a screw pile is as soon as you've installed it you can put load on top of it as opposed to a pile which generally needs to be cast and set before it can actually support any load unless it's a driven pile of course [Music] another important mechanic about understanding soil is how your structure is going to behave under an earthquake as any lateral forces your structure may see can either be made better or worse depending on the substructure of the soil so if you've got a deep soft soil such as a clay you'll behave a lot worse during an earthquake than such as a sand or a rock now why is this well a clay when it starts to rock backwards and forwards you have shock waves going backwards and forwards through the stratum of the soil that exacerbates the forces the earthquake will apply to your structure and you have other mechanics such as the previous video i did about liquefaction which happens more in your sandy materials so if you've got a high water table structures can actually sink into the soil as the soil turns more into a liquid from the shaking actions and that high water table the best material they can have for any earthquake is the rock material as when it shakes the building it's only oscillating based on the shaking of the soil and you don't get any of those additional shock waves that you'll get in those softer materials if you're interested in supporting the channel further actually set up a patreon with links in the below description what does it get you it gets you more access to me and some future members only q a's hopefully i see you over there and as always if you have any topics you wish me to cover don't forget to ask them in the below comments don't forget to like subscribe and ding that bell to get all

        "hello guys we are here with a crucial topic types of irrigation proper irrigation is the soul of agriculture for getting a healthy crop Farmers have to irrigate their land in the right way here we give you complete information about different types of irrigation systems [Music] hi friends welcome to the Discover agriculture YouTube channel if you are not yet subscribed to our Channel Please Subscribe now there are two different types of irrigation systems for agriculture as follows that is traditional method and modern method now we are explaining these two methods deeply for your understanding have a look one traditional irrigation if you consider only India data shows that over half of the labor force is occupied with different types of farming India is one of the main exporters of Oats dry fruits and natural grain products India has regularly confronted obstacles such as low Harvest yield unfavorable harvests rainstorms and other benefits traditional approaches to irrigation have overcome the majority of these issues these old irrigation strategies are not yet outdated India's Farmers utilize these techniques to guarantee appropriate seed germination a better yield of harvests and Speedy development of food crops traditional irrigation is known as organic farming irrigation there are four types of traditional irrigation systems which are as follows one check Basin method this strategy is an irrigation system type that relies upon water accessibility the cultivating land is separated into various sectors associated with a small drain water is stored at the highest place on the land from that point these channels start this type of traditional irrigation has been around for a long time two-strip irrigation method the farming land is separated into various strips such strips are isolated by made the length of each strip relies on the land's point of slope to an area of supply such a technique requires minimum labor and investment three Furrow irrigation whenever crops are filled in columns Furrow irrigation proves to be useful it is expected to be used in cultivation this type can prompt better irrigation of bigger pieces of land four Basin irrigation this traditional irrigation strategy isn't utilized for developing yields a raised stage normally made of mud or cement is made extremely near these trees channels are dogged with the goal can get water two modern irrigation the strategy of artificial Irrigation in avias with insufficient rainfall is known as the modern Aviation system it is the strategy of providing water through pumps tubes and sprays irrigation is often utilized in regions where rainfall is problematic or where droughts are regular water is equitably scattered across the field using various irrigation system procedures this water supply process can emerge from an assortment of sources it includes groundwater Springs or Wells surface water means of lakes rivers or reservoirs and treated Wastewater there are many types of modern irrigation systems which are as follows one surface irrigation the surface water system represents an enormous Gathering of water system strategies where water is dispersed by gravity over the outer layer of the field two sprinkler irrigation a sprinkler water system is a technique for applying irrigation system water like regular precipitation water circulated through lines as a rule by a pipe it splashed out of sights through sprinklers with the goal that it separates into tiny water drops which tumble to the ground three drip irrigation the drip irrigation system is a procedure wherein water courses through a channel into unique drip pipes with producers situated at various disperses water circulated through the producers straight forwardly into the soil close to the roots through a fantastic drip delivery Gadget four subsurface irrigation subsurface irrigation systems assign the sub irrigation system include a water system to crops by applying water from underneath the soil Surface by developing channels or introducing underground tile lines or punctured Pipelines five Center pivot irrigation water is scattered throughout the land by a machine of sprinklers that move on Wheel Towers in 360 Degrees pattern or a circle that would move around the land and sprinkle water all over the soil and it is really efficient and effective and this procedure or system is well recommended in a lot of countries but mostly used in the USA six lateral move irrigation water is scattered throughout the land evenly through a series of pipes or water lines they can either be controlled by hand which could be less effective compared to a man-made machine for sprinkling water all over the land the sprinkles move only a recommended distance on the field and for the next land the reconnection of the water hose is required to cover the next distance compared to the other irrigation systems the lateral move irrigation system tends to be way cheaper but requires a lot of Labor or Manpower seven brain irrigation system rain pipe is suitable for closely spaced crops onion vegetable crops leafy vegetables groundnut Etc it sprays water up to 10 to 15 feet to each side this system imitates natural rain pipe irrigation system is very economical and there are no huge costs to install the system crops get atmospheric nitrogen with the help of this artificial rain due to this the growth of the crops gets increases and crops get natural fertilizer in the form of nitrogen you can spray fertilizer in the entire field by applying a Venturi system to the Rain irrigation system this pipe is made with HTTP Fabric and it has Zig Jarred and randomly punched holes by the laser system 8. fog irrigation system these systems typically work with relatively High pressures about 2-4 bar they are used in greenhouses to reduce ambient temperature and increase relative humidity these systems May adjust flow rates and droplet size by changing the nozzle for use according to the production needs regulating water pressure in the head you can accomplish the same End by adapting the application to the humidification cooling irrigation an application of fertilizers or pesticides application manual irrigation water is scattered evenly around the field with the help of manual power such as labor pipe and watering cans this system is very labor

      "name": "What is Engineering Mechanics?",
      "caption":
        "when you start an engineering degree you are faced with many challenges and questions and today we are going to try and answer one of them that is what is engineering mechanics you may have noticed this word mechanics seems to show up a lot in many of the courses you have to take from early courses on statics and dynamics to later courses on fluid mechanics and fracture mechanics what is meant by this term mechanics let's start with what it is not don't confuse the word mechanics in engineering with the profession of a mechanic although an engineering you will learn the wonders of wd-40 and duct tape for fixing things this is not the core of what mechanics means in an engineering sense for engineers mechanics describes the behavior of bodies in terms of a state of rest or motion when subjected to forces there are three key words in this definition bodies motion and forces what do we mean by these terms the term bodies refers to any physical object such as an aircraft or a rocket but could really be anything even a potato in lots of mechanics textbooks you will see generalized bodies drawn as potato shaped blobs like this we will often use such a representation of a body when introducing new concepts in this course and you will often hear me refer to it as an engineering potato motion is a more obvious term it refers to how a body moves including both translation and rotation as well as speed and acceleration this leaves us with forces forces can be defined as interactions that will change the motion of a body if they are on a post how can we think about that in practical terms if we want to move an object we can either push it or pull it so we can think of forces as a necessary push or pull to cause motion lucky for us a really smart physicist by the name of Isaac Newton came up with some handy laws to describe the interrelationship between forces bodies and their motion as smart people tend to get their name attached to smart things they do these laws are aptly referred to as Newton's three laws of motion so let's briefly review these laws Newton's first law states that every object persists in a state of rest or uniform motion in a straight line unless it is compelled to change that stated by forces impressed upon it in other words bodies are inherently lazy and do not want to change their state of motion you require a force to push or pull that body from rest or to change the speed or direction of its motion Newton's second law states that the resultant force of an object is equal to the change in momentum or change in time this can be written as f is equal to the time derivative of the mass times velocity now you're probably thinking to yourself wait a second that wasn't what I was taught in high school we were taught that force is equal to mass times acceleration so did your high school teacher lie to you well yes and no force is equal to mass times acceleration is a special case of Newton's second law if the mass is constant it can come outside of the derivative and the time derivative of velocity is simply acceleration so yes force does equal mass times acceleration as long as the mass can be considered constant this is most of the time valid as an assumption at least over a small time increment Newton's third law states that for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction there is a balance to forces and a lot of engineering is about analyzing that balance as you will see throughout your studies only three laws governing motion a sounds pretty easy or is it let's try to apply these laws to analyze a takeoff of a commercial jet let's start with Newton's second law force equals mass times acceleration what are the forces involved in an aircraft at takeoff during takeoff there are our number of forces acting on the aircraft there is the distributed lift force acting on the wings that varies both in the span-wise direction of the wing and in the chord wise direction as well there is a thrust of the engines which also produces a complex distributed load due to the mixing of cold thrusts from the fan and hot thrust from the engine core we then have substantial drag produced by the landing gear and by the entire surface area of the aircraft flight control surfaces such as ailerons can also impart forces on the aircraft and we shouldn't forget to take into account potential loads due to wind gusts but that is only one side of the equation we also have to think about the accelerations in addition to the overall acceleration of the aircraft there are local accelerations occurring as well the wings flex causing different accelerations along the wing and the flaps and landing gear will begin to retract to reduce drag as these states of motion continuously change all of the forces we previously mentioned will also be changing making the state of motion quite complex to analyze so the only way to practically do this would be with a tremendous amount of computational and engineering manpower just to get one answer the take-off conditions additionally in design situations where you are trying to develop a new aircraft concept the constraints around these calculations will constantly be changing requiring calculations to start from scratch and time again so what can we do about this well as you will learn throughout your engineering career engineering is about making models and models are basically simplified representations of what we are really interested in understanding so for a lot of engineering analyses we simplify the problem greatly so that we can produce quick calculations that can be used to make early design decisions for instance we can take all the complicated physics and aerodynamics of an aircraft and approximate them as simple distributed loads alternatively we can simplify further by reducing aircraft to a single point mass with all the complex loads represented as resulting forces now you may ask yourself don't we risk being wrong in our calculations by oversimplifying can such simple models really be useful in the context of something so complicated this is where I need to tell you a big secret about engineers engineers are not concerned about being right in fact I would argue that engineers are never right but that's okay because engineering is not about being right but being right enough we will make assumptions and simplifications that make our results ultimately wrong but right enough to be useful in our design process but there is a caveat to this ultimately people's lives depend on our engineering designs functioning properly so it is very important to know the limitations of our engineering models and the consequence of these on our designs this is why it is so important to focus on conceptual understanding throughout your engineering studies it is critical for you to understand the concepts behind different analysis techniques and engineering models so that you can properly assess if they are right enough for your application this is also why you may find your professor paying a lot of attention to whether or not your answer makes sense in the context of the problem at hand we need to be critical of the results we obtain and not simply follow steps and procedures but we'll talk about this in a later video we have covered that engineering mechanics is the field that describes the motion of bodies when subjected to forces and that engineers use simplified models to describe this behavior then why are there so many different courses on mechanics essentially we start at the simplest case as slowly introduce more and more complexity into our models at first we'll start by modeling bodies as rigid objects examining Newton's laws of motion for when the body is not accelerating a course we call statics and then when the body is accelerating of course we call dynamics however as you will learn it is not always appropriate to model bodies as rigid objects sometimes we have to consider how the material within the body behaves we introduce the deformation behavior of solid materials in the course solid mechanics sometimes also referred to as mechanics of materials fluids also behave differently than solids so we examine appropriate methods to model fluid motion in the course fluid mechanics even this course can be further subdivided in to recognize the differences in behavior of fluid flow that is subsonic transonic and supersonic in nature then there are aspects such as oscillatory motion and from material failure that can also further complicate our engineering models leading to courses in vibrations and fracture mechanics and this is a highly simplified view of these topics you'll be examining in the context of engineering mechanics in order to describe the forces involved in our models we have to examine concepts of energy and energy transfer in the field of thermodynamics that thrust in an aircraft engine doesn't just appear out of thin air and in parallel to all of this we need to equip you with many additional tools to perform your analysis different fields of mathematics programming skills and even drawing skills become necessary tools in this engineering toolbox [Music] Wow as you can see it takes a lot of effort to be wrong like an engineer but also right enough like an engineer",

        "basic concept of thermodynamics thermodynamics the word thermodynamics was derived from the greek words term means heat and dynamics means force so thermodynamics is essentially the study of forces due to heat or heat due to forces now we can say that the study of the flow of the heat or any other form of energy into or out of a system as it undergoes a physical or chemical transformation is called thermodynamics thermodynamic terms system a thermodynamic system or simply system is that part of the universe which is under thermodynamic study surroundings the space outside the thermodynamic system is known as surroundings system boundary anything which is separating the system from the surroundings is called boundary the boundary may be real or imaginary rigid or non-rigid it may also be permeable or non-permeable or adiabatic or non-adiabatic universe the system and the surroundings combine to make up the universe types of system types of system depending on the nature of the boundary thermodynamic system can be described in three different ways there open closed and isolated now what is open system an open system can exchange mass and energy usually in the form of heat with its surroundings closed system a closed system is one in which energy but not mass can be passed to or from the surroundings isolated system an isolated system is one that can transfer neither mass nor energy to and from its surroundings here are some examples of these three systems on the basis of composition there are two types of systems homogeneous system and heterogeneous system homogeneous system when a system is uniform throughout it is called a homogeneous system this system is made of one phase only examples a pure single solid liquid or a gas a mixture of gases or liquids such a system has one phase only heterogeneous system a heterogeneous system is one which consists of two or more phases it is not uniform throughout examples water with eyes floating on it eyes in contact with water vapor these two systems have three homogeneous bodies such as water water vapor and ice the chemical compositions of the three phases are same but they constitute separate phases one more example is two or more immiscible liquids thermodynamic properties thermodynamic properties are defined as characteristic feature of a system capable of specifying the system state these are all microscopic in nature in general thermodynamic properties can be divided into two classes and they are intensive properties and extensive properties now what are actually called intensive properties and intensive property is a property of matter that depends only on the type of matter in the system and not on the size or the amount for example chemical potential concentration pressure temperature density refractive index specific heat capacity melting and boiling point color and viscosity explanation if a glass of pure 100 ml water and a beaker of pure 1 liter water is uniform in temperature which is 20 degree celsius then concentration density melting and boiling point refractive index color viscosity specific heat capacity has to be same an extensive property is a property that depends on the amount of matter in the system such as amount of substances energy enthalpy entropy gibbs energy heat capacity hemhouse energy internal energy mass and volume as we know extensive properties are proportional to the amount of substances so if we increase the number of solid cubes then amount of substances mass volume heat capacity internal energy enthalpy and energy has to  be increased or decreased state of a system thermodynamic state of a system is its condition at a specific time that is fully identified by the values of a suitable set of parameters known as state variables state parameters or thermodynamic variables so how you define the state variables when the properties of a system define the state of that system is called state variables explanation consider a gas in a beaker with a movable piston this is represented by state 1 and it is having a fixed value of pressure p1  volume v1 temperature t1 etc gas can be cooled or heated either in constant pressure or constant temperature or constant volume etc then the gas is changed in another condition the new condition is represented by state 2. at state 2 it is having another fixed volume  of pressure p2 volume v2 temperature t2 etc therefore the state may be represented identified  or described by certain observable microscopic properties such as volume temperature pressure  concentration internal energy enthalpy etc state function a state function is  a thermodynamic property of a system whose value depends only on the present  state of the system and is independent of the path by which the state was reached  state function is also known as point function explanations consider a mountain climber hiking  up a mountain the climber may decide to take path a which is steep root or part b  which gradually winds up to the top but climbing up by the direct root which is path  a is more difficult as it is almost vertical than the carving root which is part b whether the  climber takes a direct route or carving route the individual's altitude at the end is the same  thus altitude is the state function because it depends only on the final destination not how the climber got to that altitude similarly volume pressure internal energy  enthalpy entropy are the state functions path function a path function is a  thermodynamic property of the system whose value depends upon the path by which the system changes from its initial to final stage let's see an explanation let us consider two cities a and b are connected by a straight line and its length is 100 kilometer there  are two more routes linking a to b with length 150 kilometer and 200 kilometer if the distance traveled by a car from a to b where route 2 or 3 then work done and fuel consumption are dependent on the root and the mileage of the car however the locations of a and b are fixed and they are independent of the roots hence the two cities a and b are the state functions while  fuel consumpt and work done are path function similarly arc length and heat both are  path functions because their magnitudes depends on the path followed during  a process as well as the final stage if

      "name": "How car engine works? / 4 stroke internal combustion engine",
      "caption":
        "Operation of the Internal Combustion Engine, or ICE The internal combustion engine converts the combustion energy of the fuel inside the engine into mechanical energy. One type of internal combustion engine is the reciprocating piston engine. The vast majority of vehicles are powered by a four-stroke reciprocating engine. In this video, we will go over the operation of such engines using the example of a four-stroke piston engine powered by gasoline. We can now see the crank mechanism and the valve timing mechanism. The former is propelled by the energy released during fuel combustion and converts such energy into rotational, mechanical energy. The valve timing mechanism is needed to open the inlet and exhaust valves. It can be put in motion by gear, belt, or chain drive from the crankshaft. For the sake of simplicity, we will only review the operation of one cylinder. The engine’s operation cycle consists of four strokes, or two crankshaft revolutions. The four-stroke cycle is then repeated. Stroke one, intake. Stroke two, compression. Stroke three, power. Stroke four, exhaust. During a stroke, the piston travels between two extreme positions known as the top dead center and the bottom dead center. Two-stroke engines exist as well, but they are rarely found in cars. Stroke one, intake. The piston travels down from top dead center to bottom dead center. The cylinder volume expands, creating vacuum pressure. At the same time, the camshaft causes the inlet valves to open, allowing the fuel-air mixture to enter the cylinder. In modern-day vehicles, gasoline is supplied via an injector, whereas in the past, carburetors performed this function. The stroke is completed when the piston reaches bottom dead center and the inlet valves close. The second stroke is compression. This stroke starts at bottom dead center and ends at top dead center. All valves are closed. The cylinder volume is reduced, causing the fuel-air mixture to compress. The compression raises the cylinder’s temperature and pressure. As the piston approaches top dead center, the spark at the spark plug ignites the fuel-air mixture. This stroke is finished when the piston reaches top dead center. The third stroke is the power stroke. This is the climax of combustion. The combustion process generates a large amount of heat, and the cylinder pressure can get up to 900 psi. The pressure of expanding gases causes the piston to move from top dead center to bottom dead center and turn the crankshaft via the connecting rod, thereby converting thermal energy into mechanical work. This stroke completes when the piston reaches bottom dead center. The fourth stroke starts at bottom dead center and ends at top dead center. The camshaft opens the exhaust valves, and the piston expels the exhaust gases from the cylinder. When the piston approaches top dead center, the exhaust valves close, completing the last stroke — the exhaust — and the entire operation cycle. The operation cycle is then repeated. Three subsystems feed the engine with fuel and air and then expel exhaust gases: The intake system The fuel supply system The exhaust system Furthermore, normal engine operation necessitates the use of the lubrication and cooling systems. The proper operation of these systems extends engine life. Please keep in mind that we are watching the engine in slow motion. In fact, the crankshaft turns an average of seven hundred revolutions per minute at idle speed. The upper limit on production cars reaches eight thousand revolutions per minute. Engine speeds in Formula One cars can get as high as twenty-two thousand revolutions per minute. You can check the revolutions per minute value on an instrument called a tachometer on your car’s dashboard. The operation of the engine begins with the car starting system — the starter motor starts spinning, engaging the flywheel. The flywheel then stores the energy from the power stroke to use it until the next power stroke. The strokes alternate in the different engine cylinders in a certain sequence. This is known as the engine firing order and is required for more stable engine operation. The firing order for this engine is one - three - four - two. It means that the power stroke occurs in the first cylinder, then the third, fourth, and finally the second cylinder. The sequence is then repeated. Please note that gasoline engines are spark-ignition engines, since it is the ignition system, namely the spark plug, that ignites the fuel-air mixture. The primary goal of this system is to ignite the fuel-air mixture on time. Ignition timing is critical to the efficient operation of the engine. There is some time between the appearance of a spark and the complete ignition of the fuel-air mixture and the maximum gas pressure. The piston moves some distance during this time. For maximum engine efficiency, the piston must be within 10 - 12 degrees of top dead center at maximum gas pressure. It means that the ignition system must start in advance. The moment at which the spark plug fires is called the ignition advance angle. The optimal ignition advance angle is determined by crankshaft speed. The higher the crankshaft speed, the earlier the spark plug must fire. If the crankshaft speed is low, the ignition advance angle should be closer to top dead center. In modern engines, ignition timing, fuel injection, and many other tasks are controlled by an engine management system with the engine control unit at its heart, assisted by various sensors. The driver only needs to supply air, which is accomplished with the help of the accelerator pedal, also known as the gas pedal. Please keep in mind that, in order to improve engine efficiency, the inlet and exhaust valves open and close prematurely and belatedly relative to the dead centers. The exact timing of the opening and closing of the valves is called valve timing. The optimal valve timing is set during camshaft design and does not change during engine operation. However, if the engine is equipped with a variable valve timing system, valve timing may vary during engine operation depending on the engine operating mode. Fuel-air mixture. The fuel-air mixture in gasoline engines is made up of air and gasoline. The mixture is prepared using a certain fuel to air ratio. Ideally, complete combustion of one kilogram of gasoline requires fourteen point seven kilograms of air. But in fact, the engine employs various mixture ratios. The ratio of one to fourteen point seven is the best in terms of power and economy. By reducing the amount of air, we get a more powerful engine but a poorer fuel economy. By increasing the amount of air, we get a more economical but less powerful engine. This range is suitable for normal engine operation. Further changes in the gasoline-to-air ratio will result in increased gasoline consumption and decreased power. Misfiring of the engine is also possible. This concludes our review. For more information on engine subsystems and other topics, watch our next videos. Bye guys!",

      "caption":
        "thermal power plants help me almost half of the world's power demand they use water as the working fluid today's thermal power plants are capable to run under green efficiency by conforming to stringent environmental standards in this video we will see how a coal-based thermal power plant achieves this in a detailed step-by-step manner by turning the shaft of this generator we will be able to generate electricity the generator derives motion from a steam turbine the heart of the power plant in order to turn steam turbine, you have to supply a high pressure and high temperature steam at the inlet of the turbine as the turbine absorbs energy from the high-energy fluid its pressure and temperature drop toward the outlet you can take a closer look at the uniquely shaped steam turbine rotor blades high capacity power plant often use different stages of steam turbines such as high pressure turbine intermediate pressure turbine and low pressure turbine so now we have met our objective, we have produced electricity from the generator if we can bring the low pressure and low temperature steam back to their original states which were of a much higher pressure and temperature we can repeat the process the first step is to raise the pressure you can use a compressor for this purpose but compressing steam is a highly energy intensive process and such a power plant will not be efficient at all the easy way is to convert the steam into liquid and boost the pressure for this purpose we'll introduce condenser heat exchangers which sit beneath the low pressure turbine in the condenser a stream of cold water flows through the tubes the steam rejects heat to this liquid stream and became condensed now we can use the pump to increase the pressure of this feed water typically multistages traffical pumping is used for this purpose that way the pressure will revert to its original state the next task is to bring the temperature back to its original value for this purpose heat is added to the exit of the pump with the help of a boiler high capacity power plants generally use a type of boiler called a water tube boiler pulverized coal is then burnt inside boiler the incoming water initially passes through any economizer session here the water will capture energy from the flue gas the water flow straight down-comer and then through water walls, where transforms into steam the pure steam is separated at a steam drum now the working fluid is back to its original state high pressure and high temperature this steam can be fed back into the steam turbine and the cycle can be repeated over and over again for continuous power production but a power plant working on this basic Rankine cycle will have a very low efficiency and a low capacity we can increase the performance of the power plant considerably with the help of a few simple techniques in case of super heating even after the liquid has been converted into steam even more heat is added and with that the steam becomes super-heated the higher the temperature of the steam the more efficient the cycle just remember the Carnot's theorem of maximum thermal efficiency possible but the steam turbine material will not withstand temperatures of more than 600 degrees celsius so super heating is limited to the threshold the temperature of the steam decreases as it flows along the rows of the blade consequently a great way to increase the efficiency of the power plant is to add more heat after the first turbine stage this is known as reheating and it will increase the temperature of the steam again leading to a high power output and greater efficiency the low pressure size of the power plan are prone to suck the atmospheric air even with sophisticated ceiling arrangements the dissolved gases in the feed water will spoil the boiler material over time to remove these dissolved gases and open feedwater heater is introduced hot steam from the turbine is mixed into the feed water steam bubbles so generated will absorb the dissolved gases the mixing also preheats the feed water which helps improve the efficiency of the power plant to an even greater extent all these techniques make the modern power plant work under an efficiency range of forty to forty-five percent now we'll take a look at how heat addition and heat rejection are executed in an actual power plant the cold liquid is supplied at the condenser with the help of a cooling tower the heated up water from the condensor are rid is sprayed in the cooling tower which induces a natural air draft and the sprayed water loses heat this is how a colder liquid is always provided at the condenser inlet at a heatdation inside the burning coal produces many pollutants we cannot release these pollutants directly into the atmosphere so before transferring them to a stack the exhaust gases cleaned in an Electro Static Precipitator the ESP uses plates with high voltage static electricity to absorb the pollutant particles we hope that we've given you new insights into the inner workings of thermal power plants Thank you for watching the video",

      "caption":
        "Hey friends, welcome to the YouTube channel ALL ABOUT ELECTRONICS. So, this is the introductory video on the digital electronics. And in this video, we will learn some of the basics of the digital electronics. And in the upcoming series of videos, we will learn this digital electronics in detail. So, this digital electronics is a field of electronics which deals with the digital signals. That means the signals which is processed or generated using the electronic circuit are digital in nature. So, these smartphones, personal computers, and many communication equipment which we are using in our day-to-day life are the example of it. On the other end, the analog electronics is a field of electronics which deals with the analog signals. So, the amplifiers, timing, and the wave-shaping circuits are the example of the analog circuits. So before understanding this digital electronics, first we should be very clear about the analog signal and the digital signals. So this analog signal is a type of signal, whose amplitude can take any value in the given range. So the voice signal is the example of the analog signal. Let's say, we are looking at the signal at the output of some amplifier which can take any value in the range of 0 to 10V. So in the given range, this signal can take any value. That means in the given range, there are infinite possibilities. So such signal is called analog signal. Now in the time domain, this analog signal could be continuous or discrete. That means in the time domain, it may exist continuously or it may exist at the discrete time interval. For example, the voice signal is the continuous analog signal. On the other end, if you measure the temperature of any CT at the interval of 1 hour, then it is the case of the discrete signal. But on the y-axis, this temperature can have any value in the given range. But if you see the time scale, then in the time scale, it is the discrete signal. So that is the analog signal whose amplitude can take any value in the given range. And most of the naturally occurring signals are analog in nature. For example, the voice signal or the temperature or the pressure which we are measuring are the example of the analog signals. On the other end, the digital signals are the one whose amplitude can take only finite values. For example, the signal which is shown over here varies only between the two values. So it is the example of the digital signal. And in the time domain, this digital signal could be continuous or discrete. So virtually, all the modern digital circuits  which we know are working on the two voltage levels. One is the high voltage level, which is often referred as the logic high, and the second one is the low voltage level, which is often referred as the logic low. And since this type of digital circuits are working on only two discrete voltage levels, so the digital input and output of this type of circuit is often represented by the binary number system. For example, the logic high or the high voltage level can be represented by the binary one and the logic low or the low voltage level can be represented by the binary zero. So in terms of the voltage level, the high voltage level could be a 5V and the low voltage level could be 0V. But in reality, the logic one and the logic zero are represented by the voltage range rather than the particular voltage level. For example, for any digital signal to be considered as logic one, it is not always necessary to be 5V. And even if the voltage level is within a certain band, then also it can be considered as logic one. For example, if the voltage level of the signal is within 2V to 5V range, then also it can be considered as logic one. Similarly, let's say, if the signal level is within 0V to 0.8V, then also it can be considered as logic zero. That means as far as the signal level is in a certain band, then it can be identified as either logic zero or the logic one. And that is the advantage of this digital system. Because even if the noise or the interference gets superimposed on the actual signal, then also as far as the signal level is within a certain band, then it is possible to identify that signal as either logic zero or the logic one. So that is the one of the advantages of this digital system over the analog system. The other advantage of this digital system is that, the digital data is easy to store, replicate and process. The same is not true with the analog system. Moreover, the digital systems are more accurate and reliable than the analog systems. And with the advancement in the fabrication technology over the years, the digital circuits are very much easy to fabricate and it is also possible to fabricate them in the larger density. And compared to the analog system, these digital systems are relatively easily scalable. So these are some of the advantages of the digital system over the analog system. But the thing is, all the naturally occurring signals are analog in nature. So if we want to process them in the digital domain, then first of all, we need to convert that analog signal into the digital signal. So using the analog to digital converter, it is possible to convert the analog signal into the digital signal. And then after, it can be processed using the digital circuits. And if required, then using the digital to analog converter or the DAC, it can be converted back into the analog form. So this ADC and the DAC are also a very integral part of these digital systems. And in fact, on the channel, these ADCs and the DACs are already covered in detail. So for more information, you can check this playlist on this ADC and the DAC. Now in these digital circuits, since the voltage level continuously switches between the high and the low levels, so they are also known as the switching circuits. And using these digital circuits, it is also possible to perform several logic operations, where the output is high or low based on certain logic conditions. And therefore, they are also known as the logic circuits. For example, using this digital circuit, it is possible to design a circuit which will turn on the fan when it is daytime and whenever the temperature goes beyond 25 degrees. So the logic gates are the basic building block in the digital electronics. And there are several types of logic gates. So this AND gate, NOT gate and OR gate are the three basic types of logic gates. And using these three gates, it is possible to implement any logic function. Apart from that, there are two universal gates. And they are called universal gates because using any of these two gates alone, it is possible to perform or implement any logic operation. So apart from all these gates, there are two more gates, which are known as the XOR gate and the XNOR gate. So using all these logic gates, it is possible  to perform different logic operations. And any logic operation which can be implemented using these logic gates can be expressed using the Boolean expression. And using the Boolean algebra, it is possible to minimize the Boolean expression. So this minimization of this Boolean expression is also a very important part in the digital circuits. Because with the minimization of this Boolean expression, it is possible to reduce the number of logic gates which is required to implement certain logic operations. So in the upcoming videos, we will learn more about these different logic gates. And we will see that, how these different functions can be implemented using these logic gates. Now in general, there are two types of digital circuits. That is the combinational circuit and the sequential circuit. So these combinational circuits are the one where the output of the circuit only depends on the present input. While in case of the sequential circuits, the output of the circuit also depends on the present input as well as the past outputs. So we can say that these sequential circuits also have a memory element. So this flip-flop is a very basic sequential circuit which can store one bit of information. And using these combinational and sequential circuits, it is possible to perform different logic operations. For example, the arithmetic operations like addition and subtraction can be performed using these digital circuits. And the other operations are comparison, encoding and decoding, multiplexing and demultiplexing, storing and counting. So in the upcoming videos, we will learn about all these different digital circuits in detail. Alright, so now let's see the sequence in which we will study all these topics. Now since the digital circuit deals with the binary inputs, so first of all, we will start with the binary number system and the binary codes. Then after, we will learn different logic gates and we will see that how the output of the logic gates can be expressed using the Boolean expression. And we will also learn a little bit about the Boolean algebra. And we will see that using this Boolean algebra and the other technique, how we can minimize the logic functions. And after that, we will learn different combinational and sequential circuits which we have discussed earlier. And after that, we will also learn about the different logic families. So although these logic gates are very basic elements of the digital circuits, but inside if you see, then it is the combination of different transistors. And there are different ways to construct these logic gates. So depending on how these logic gates are implemented, the different characteristics of the logic gate, like power consumption, switching speed and the voltage levels will change. So in the upcoming series of videos, we will learn all these aspects. So that's it for this video, and I hope in this video, you got the basic overview of these digital circuits. So if you have any question or suggestion, then do let me know here in the comment section below. If you like this video, hit the like button and subscribe the channel for more such videos.",

        "hey everyone welcome to this lecture series of digital signal processing this is the first video in the lecture series and in this video we will introduce ourselves to digital signal processing here is the outline of this video first we will see what is meant by digital signal processing then we talk about signals and their classifications later we will see the block diagram of a dsp system followed by the advantages disadvantages and applications of a tsp system so let's get started [Music] what is digital signal processing digital signal processing is concerned with the representation of signals by sequence of numbers or symbols and the processing of these sequences as you can see there are three main points in this sentence signals representation of signals and processing of these signals so what is a signal a signal can be defined as a function that conveys information generally about the state or behavior of a physical system for example while i am speaking i am generating audio signals using my vocal cord for instance when i say out the alphabet a i am generating an audio signal that conveys the information of alphabet a now mathematically signals are represented as functions of one or more independent variables if we take the same example of audio signals the amplitude of my voice can be plotted as a function of time that is if we take time on the x-axis and on the y-axis if we plot the corresponding amplitude at each instance of time we get a signal here the independent variable is time t and the signal which is my voice is plotted as a function of time if you see this signal is defined continuously in time also it has continuous amplitudes so this is an analog signal another form of signals are discrete signals they are signals that are defined only at discrete units of time to obtain discrete signals all we have to do is sample the analog signals at discrete units of time for instance let's sample this analog signal for that first let us split the time axis into discrete units that is we mark the x-axis at equal distances then we obtain the amplitude of signal at this discrete times now if we plot only these points we get a discrete signal let me show that to you so let me cut this discrete points and paste it over here so this is a discrete signal okay now many people often confuse analog signals with continuous time signals let me make this very clear for you analog signals and continuous time signals are not the same another common misconception is that discrete signals and digital signals are the same even the name of this course digital signal processing is based on that misconsumption but understand that digital signals and discrete signals are not the same so the true name of this course should be discrete signal processing as we are only dealing with discrete signals throughout the course but since universities around the world name it as digital signal processing i am also following the same name for those who are interested i am explaining the difference between these four signals in another video and the link to that video is available in the descriptions below okay so far we learned what is a signal how signals are represented and how signals are classified into analog and discrete signals now let's learn what is signal processing signal processing involves analyzing modifying and synthesizing signals to pull or extract meaning out of it signal processing can be broadly classified into analog signal processing and digital signal processing as you can guess analog signal processing deals with transformation of analog signals and the processing is done using electrical networks consisting of active and passive elements that is op-amps resistors capacitors inductors etc on the other hand digital signal processing deals with the processing of discrete signals here the processing is done by general purpose computers or by digital circuits such as r6 fpgas or specialized dsp chips now let us understand the block diagram of a dsp system there are mainly 5 blocks in the diagram they are pre-filter analog to digital converter or adcs dsps or digital signal processors dacs or digital to analog converters and pause filter this pre-filter is usually a low pass filter and is used to filter out unwanted high frequency components from the raw analog input signal for example if we are processing audio signals we only need frequencies in the range of 20 hertz to 20 kilohertz and this pre-filter will filter out any frequencies about 20 kilohertz as they can cause noise next the adc will convert analog signals to digital signals then these signals are fed to the dsp where it is analyzed and processed and the synthesized output is fed to the dac the dac converts digital signals back into analog signals and finally this post filter is used to filter out any unwanted high frequency components in the generated analog signal now most often we also provide an amplifier at the beginning and at the end this is to amplify the incoming and outgoing signals now coming to the applications we use digital signal processing in many areas it is used to process speech and audio this involves speech recognition and analysis noise filtering echo cancellation etc it is also used to process image and video this involves compression enhancement reconstruction and restoration of images and videos it also involves face detection like in the case of face unlocking fonts dsps are also used in military and telecommunication applications for example sonar and navigation radar tracking modulation and demodulation etc next application is in biomedical and healthcare sector for example analysis of ecgs eegs and x-ray signals another application is consumer electronics most digital equipments in your home like smartphones televisions digital cameras etc have a dsp embedded in it to accelerate its performance now let's see the advantages of dsp the main advantage of digital signal processing is its simplicity that is compared to analog signal processing digital signal processing can perform complicated signal analysis with relative easiness without the use of complex circuits also the processing can be easily modified with simple changes in software that is dsp systems are flexible also with dsps we have access to many error detection and correction features for example parity generation and correction also with dsp systems data storage is easier since digital storage devices are becoming cheaper day by day storage of data is much easier in digital forms it is also easier to transport and recreate digital data with hundred percent fidelity another advantage is low cost with advancements in vlsi technology the cost of dsps have come down by many faults than their analog counterparts now coming to the disadvantages of dsp systems dsps are made out of a lot of transistors and these transistors together consume a lot more power than analog signal processors another problem is the higher learning curve required for the operation of dsp systems each dsp has different hardware architecture and software instructions due to this highly skilled engineers are needed to program the device and proper training on dsp is required for programming for various applications okay now let's summarize what all we learned in this lecture first we defined a signal and we learned that signals are primarily classified into analog signals and discrete signals then we learned about signal processing which is analyzing modifying and synthesizing of signals then we saw the block diagram of dsp systems followed by the applications advantages and disadvantages of dsp systems i hope all the concepts that were taught in this lecture are clear to all of you if anyone has any doubts please feel free to ask in the comment section below either we or some other viewer will surely help you out if you found this lecture to be useful please like the video and support us by subscribing to the channel in the next video we will learn about frequency domain sampling thanks for watching top early and have a great day",

      "caption":
        "in 1886 German physicist Heinrich Hertz made a startling discovery he noticed that a spark generated on one side of a room would cause another spark to appear between a metal gap on the other side of the room at the exact same time even though they were not connected this is because an electric spark creates an invisible wave of energy that propagates outwards in a spherical pattern and when this wave passes through any piece of metal such as a nearby wire it causes it to vibrate electrically and generates an electric current in the wire known as electrical induction it was later discovered that these were actually invisible light waves known as radio waves this discovery led to the radio Telegraph the transmitter is simple it's just a powerful battery which sends electrical pulses through an antenna whenever a key is pressed each pulse of electrical current generates a radio wave and far away on the receiving end is an identical loop of wire or antenna which is connected to a device which can measure electrical current known as a receiver by the 1980s we needed a fast way to transmit a growing amount of digital data doing it by hand wasn't practical to send digital data rapidly using radio waves is a two-step process first the transmitter sends out a continuous radio wave we call a carrier wave this can be done by sending an alternating electrical current through an antenna the second step is to send a message on top of the carrier wave this is done by changing the strength of the electrical pulses at the transmitter between high and low known as amplitude modulation on the receiving end these low versus high amplitude waves are converted into pulses of electrical current and the low waves are converted into zeros and the high waves are converted back into ones and that's the basis of digital wireless and remember antennas send out signals in all directions and just like with sound when a loud siren rings everyone in the area can hear it so with a single powerful transmitter we can send signals to many devices in a general area and the signal will reach each device even as it moves around this works because radio waves can travel through most nonmetallic surfaces such as walls the only thing that blocks them are surfaces with high metal caption such as metallic structures or rocks however when they hit a metallic surface they bounce just like light does so the signal can arrive thanks to reflections think of these as radio echoes and this makes it easier for signals to reach around corners from transmitter to receiver and it's why we are used to getting a cell phone signal almost anywhere but of course in certain locations the positioning between the device and the base station is such that your signal can get lost and this can be caused by the unwanted consequences of these radio echoes they can interfere with each other most often what happens is two or more copies reach the receiver and just like in water these overlapping waves interact with each other adding together to create a third wave the third wave represents the addition of both waves if the waves arrive at the same time then the third wave is amplified resulting in a very strong signal known as constructive interference it's the good kind of interference we run into a problem though when the waves arrive at different times this happens when two signals travel slightly different distances from transmitter to receiver because they follow different paths this results in one wave being shifted in time compared to the other we call this a phase shift if two signals arrive and one is shifted exactly by half a wave cycle they cancel each other out resulting in a lost signal this is known as destructive interference it's the bad kind of interference and there is one other case to consider this is when the arriving signals combine to give a signal that is shifted by half a wave cycle causing the wave to flip and this is also a good kind of interference since the receiver just needs to detect high versus low waves and so it's this balance between constructive and destructive interference that determines the quality of the received signal we express this using something called a fading characteristic represented with the letter H so for example if a single copy of a signal arrives with no other interference then there is no fading we express this as H equals 1 usually what happens is there is some other imbalance of constructive and destructive interference so the key problem becomes how can we combat the situation when H equals zero in the mid-1990s several researchers from the information theory Society introduced the concept of space-time codes it was based on the following insight we can use multiple observations to decrease the chances that we will lose data due to destructive fading first realize that when you have a bad signal someone nearby may have a good one and that's because different environments experience different echo patterns or fading characteristics this is why moving your phone around will often result in better signals so imagine we connected a second antenna to a mobile phone and separated them by some distance and let's say receiver one experience is fading h1 maybe it's perfectly destructive so h1 equals zero and receiver two experiences fading h2 and in this case it's a clean signal so h2 equals one and now we have a better chance of receiving the signal because just one of the two possible channels needs to be good in order to recover the data so for example if we are sending a two bit message zero one each receiving antenna will measure the original signal multiplied by the feeding characteristic receiver one will measure zero zero receiver two will measure zero one and so if one of the channels has a nonzero feeding characteristic in this case receiver two then we can recover the data the problem with this method is it's not practical to rely on multiple antennas for small devices the question is can we instead use multiple antennas at the base station or the transmit side to mimic the advantages of multiple receiver antennas for example using a second transmit antenna separated by a distance sending the same signal as before because these signals travel unique paths they will fade differently h1 and h2 and this gives us two chances to receive the signal correctly on the receiving end with a single antenna however there is one subtle problem to address to make this system work its due to the fact that the transmitted signals will combine at the receiver antenna so from the receivers perspective it looks like a single signal was received with a new fading characteristic let's call it h3 which is the addition of h1 and h2 and so if h1 and h2 happened to be perfectly out of phase they will combine to form h3 equals zero erasing the signal even though both of the channels were good on their own to address this problem space time codes were invented and we illustrate the idea with a well known construction by Ala mu T let's say the message is two symbols long a and B he sends two different symbols at each time step so transmitter one will send a be in transmitter two will send B a and as before the transmitters experience fading characteristic plus one and minus one now let's think about what would happen on the receiving end at the first time step the receiver would measure a blend of both symbols in this case B minus a and at this point the receiver doesn't know those individual values of a and B for example if it measures zero what's a and B a and B could both be 0 or both be 1 we can't say for sure yet we don't have enough information so the receiver needs more information and that's what the next time step is for transmitter 1 will send be in transmitter 2 will send a and on the receiving end it will measure a minus B and let's say this measurement works out to 0 so we know a minus B equals 0 now we have two pieces of information but that still doesn't help us because we don't know if a and B both equal 1 or a and B both equals 0 the problem here is that our second measurement a minus B can always be found from our first measure multiplying the first equation by minus one gives a minus B so our two transmissions effectively send the same information in different forms an ala Moody's clever trick to make this work was to make one of these measurements a plus B one of the transmitter needs to send the negative value or amplitude of one of the symbols at one of the time slots alamou D chooses the first symbol from transmitter two to flip using a negative so transmitter one sends a and then B transmitter two sends negative B and then a and if we do that the receiver will measure two observations B minus a and a plus B and let's say for example a plus B was measured at two now the receiver knows for sure that a equals one and B equals one and in the other case where a plus B worked out to zero then we know for sure that both a and B equals zero and that's how the individual symbols and the message are recovered it works just like we received each symbol from two different receiving antennas but using a single receiver antenna this is an exciting insight because it increases the reliability of all receiving devices using a simple code and one extra transmit antenna increasing reliability is just one of the many advantages offered by multiple antennas such systems are now known as multi input multi output or MIMO and the researchers from the information theory Society have developed the theory and practice of MIMO resulting in a new class of codes called space time codes these systems have been in use for the past 10 years and new approaches for using my mo systems are being explored for future wireless communication systems you",

        "in this video we help you understand the semiconductor industry which is interconnected and constantly evolving in the enormous semiconductor ecosystem today let's learn about the essential semiconductor manufacturing processes in the first episode we talked about silicon the main material which is used to make semiconductors in order for silicon to turn into a semiconductor chip it needs to go through the essential processes of w for manufacturing oxidation photolithography etching deposition and ion implementation metal wiring EDS and packaging let's take a closer look at these processes semiconductors are stacked high and solid to form a complex structure similar to a high-rise building constructing a building starts with the foundation a wafer is the foundation for the semiconductor most Wafers are made of silicon extracted from Sand how can these tiny grains of sand become a wafer first sand is heated until it melts into a high Purity liquid and then get solidified by crystallization the resultant silicone Rod is called an Ingot these ingots are sliced into a disc thinly sliced Wafers the surface of sliced Wafers is rough and contains defects so polishing machines are used to polish the surface of the wafer the reason is that defects on the surface could negatively affect the Precision of circuits if you look at a photo of Wafers you can see a grid pattern on the surface yes the word wafer comes from biscuit Wafers a wafer made this way is the main material for semiconductors because the larger the diameter is the greater the number of chips that can be produced per wafer is so the diameter of Wafers is becoming larger because the resultant thin disc-shaped wafer is not conductive yet a process to make Wafers semiconductive is required first Wafers go through the oxidation process oxygen or water vapor is sprayed on the wafer surface to form a uniform oxide film this oxide film protects the wafer surface during the following processes and also blocks current leakage between circuits the film acts as a strong protective shield now the foundation is ready the building up process begins just as you draw blueprints to build a building you draw a circuit design onto a wafer which is called the photolithography process it is called photo for short because it is similar to developing a photo taken on a film camera with semiconductors a photo mask functions as the film a photo mask is a glass substrate with a computer designed circuit pattern in order to draw the circuit on the wafer the photo resist a material that responds to light is applied thinly and evenly on the oxide film previously placed on the wafer now when light transfers the pattern photo mask the circuit is drawn on the wafer surface just like developing a photo a circuit pattern is imprinted on the wafer by Spring developer and removing unlit areas from the areas that are exposed to light after an inspection of the wafer to check whether the pattern is drawn well it moves on to the next step now unnecessary materials are carved out so that only the design pattern remains using a liquid or gas etching unnecessary materials are selectively removed to draw the desired design when chemical Solutions are used for etching it is called wet etching and when gas or plasma is used it is called dry etching we will talk about these details in the future let's imagine constructing a building on a semiconductor chip smaller than a fingernail and thinner than a sheet of paper the photolithography process and the etching process are repeated several times on the wafer layer by layer here an insulating film that separates and protects the stack circuits is required it is called a thin film coating the thin film at a desired molecular or Atomic level onto a wafer is called deposition since the coating is is so thin precise and sophisticated technology is required to uniformly apply the thin film on a wafer to give the semiconductor electrical characteristics ion implementation is also required a semiconductor made of silicon does not conduct electricity but adding impurities it conducts current and has conductive properties in summary through the wafer manufacturing oxidation photolithography etching deposition and ion implementation processes the wafer becomes conductive and numerous circuits are drawn on it now in order for this circuit to work an electrical signal must be applied it is necessary to create a path where electricity to pass through according to the Circuit pattern this process is called the metal wiring process it is a process that allows electricity to Flow by depositing a thin metal film using materials such as aluminum Titanium or tungsten so that electricity can pass through the semiconductor well the chip manufacturing processes are now coming toward completion the next step is EDS this is the process of testing to ensure Flawless semiconductor chips in other words it is a testing step to sort out defective chips yield is a percentage of prime chips relative to the maximum chip count on a single wafer the semiconductor chip selected through the Eds process are made in a form suitable for devices this is the last process the packaging process the wafer completed through the previous steps are cut into individual semiconductor chips that can be loaded on an electronic device an individual chip must have a path to exchange electrical signals with the outside and have a form to protect it from various external elements the wafer is cut into individual chips and the diced or saw chips are placed on the PCB board in the bonding step the contact point of the semiconductor chip placed on a substrate is connected with the contact point of the substrate then molding finishes the chip package to its desired shape after sealing the semiconductor and labeling the product name the semiconductor chip we commonly see is completed of course only after going through the final test will it become a finished product today we learned about the essential processes that produce semiconductor chips these complex processes can be separated into the pre-process up to the wafer processing stage and the postprocess which contains the testing and packaging processes we hope you now have a better understanding of how a semiconductor chip is manufactured Ed stay tuned for more interesting semiconductor episodes if you like today's video please like subscribe and turn on notifications",

        "If you look around, you'll find at least one thing that has the ability to connect to the internet. It may be your phone. It may be a laptop, your TV, or even your fridge, internet of things generally refers to the collection of all those devices. But now just, you can argue that anything that has the ability to connect to the internet and collect and share data is a part of internet of things or IOT in short. Now the question here usually is what is Audi? Why do we need it? How does it help us? How does it work in many, many more questions? So in this video, guys, we will try to answer some of those questions. So the first question, what is IOT? So just as we discussed, I already IOT it first to the collection of all those devices that have the ability to connect to the internet and collect and share data. Hence the name internet of things. So basically we have a device that collects data from its surroundings, using sensors and actuators, and sends this collected data to the internet where the processing of that data can happen. There are many devices that can be included in this classification. An example can be phone laptops, watches, DVS refrigerators, washing machines. Cars and even homes. Yes. Whole homes themselves can be a part of IOT too. You can easily see the trend over here. Most IOT devices have the word smart at the start of their names, smart phones, smart watches, smart DVS, smart refrigerators, and smart homes. So now that we have a clear idea of what IOT is, we can move to the next question. Why do we need IOT? Or how does it help us in short? It helps makes our lives. Easier and more comfortable. If we take an example, we had listed earlier, like smartphones, smartphones have more use cases than I can, you know, list here without going on for ours and ours, it can call, it allows us to watch movies. It allows us to connect to the internet, interact with strangers on veered forums shop or things. We need general entertainment. You get the idea, but let's take a better example for our understanding. Smart house. A smart house has many different features that we can talk about. One of the features is automatic lights, where the lights automatically detect your presence in the room and get switched on, or they can be voice activated. You can say activate and they'll get searched, John. And it also has his name next gen security to keep your house safe, but it allows only authorized people to enter your and locks up everything. When you leave. Then it has entertainment management, fair using devices, such as Google home, Alexa echo to keep track of your chores, to play movies and songs, et cetera. It also keeps track of temperature management, the house automatically adjust to the most, you know, temporary too, based on the surrounding climate. So you can see how it brings luxury into our lives and makes it more comfortable for us to live. Now, this is at an individual level, at a larger scale. It benefits the society as a whole too in industries. Such as healthcare, it has many use cases, doctor, patient interaction, for example, it allows for remote interaction between patients and doctors. So if a patient has any sort of a deadly disease, the doctor doesn't necessarily have to come in close contact to help the patient out. Another example here is that data analysis is improved greatly. Now doctors make amazing decisions and based on the time and the data they've been given, but computers can sometimes make better decisions. And combining doctors and computers can give us the best diagnosis possible. Follow patient. So it helps us out a lot in the healthcare industry. Farming, not farming has been one of the industries that has stayed with us since the beginning of human civilization itself. And right now is the correct time to improve upon our traditional methods and shift into modern farming to provide food for our evergreen population. Smart technologies has definitely helped us increase the productivity through new devices like smart tractors and analysis devices. That will help us to get a better data analysis of a soil, then gums, manufacturing industry. Now this industry already taken IOT with open arms. It already has automation replacing many menial jobs. I already even not only increase the interactivity, but also boost the efficiency, add production as well. In this industry then comes education industry. Now better methods to teach children are already being implemented out there that are in conjunction with IOT. A good example is augmented reality. Being used in some classes to give students a better experience of real life animals, and even extinct animals. Hence having IOT will not only be beneficial to us individually, but also be beneficial to us as a society. Then comes the next question. How does IOT work? Let's discuss the IOT architecture. There are basically four layers to it. The first layer is sensing slash device there, which is basically the thing part of IOT. This thing is basically the, with the device. It has sensors and actuators that collect the data from surroundings based on specific function. Example, preachers, sensors, atmospheric pressure sensors, and light sensors. They basically collect all the data and they give it to the embedded. Device now after the data has been collected through the sensing device layer, it goes to the connectivity layer, very descent to the cloud. Using the internet. This connection is generally me through one of the methods like via Bluetooth cellular, RFID, or NFC after that comes to data processing layer. Now the data, once it reaches the cloud is subject to the real meat of the whole process. That is the analysis part of the data. The different types of algorithms are used. Based on the type of data collected and other assumptions to get meaningful insights and patterns, then a decision is made based on the insights gain. Once the hard part is over the result of the decision is conveyed to the thing or the IOT device. And similarly changes made user interface and application. Yeah, it's the last layer. This is a layer that most of us will actually see. It is a layer we used to with dietary device. It can be the touch screen or the buttons that is on the device. It's basically the front end to all the backend processing, which included the previous level. Now a good example to explain this processes, let's say a fridge, a smart fridge. Now sensors in the smart fridge, collect data from the surrounding. They see what kind of temperature it is. Let's say it's 34 degrees. And what kind of item is being stored inside the fridge? Once it collects all of this data, it sends it to a central cloud where the processing happens based on this collected data. The system decides the inside temperature of the fridge. It should be 20 degrees and we can see the result of this on the interactive screen, on the fridge. Now we had no involvement in this process, but we saw the result that we wanted. This is how IOT works in adjust. What kind of feature does IOT have? It would not be crazy to see that we may live in a future. Heart Lake Howard is depicted in scifi movies, not the star or Skype, but more like the blatant and Ironman kind. But everything we touch on, everything we used is connected to the internet, buried with central cloud, where all of our data is being collected and being utilized to make a lie, Anna society a much better place. You can assume almost everything is going to be automated and connected to the internet, everything, your table, your phones, which are already are your doors, your hangers, you know, examples. And you can see that all of them are going to be a part of IRD in future. And. There is definitely a lot of space for growth. So if you're thinking of a career in this field, not at all a bad idea, it will be both satisfying and challenging DW flow from everything we use. And it will be used to make our lives easier. Every person, no matter what background or what profession they are from will be affected by it in both good and bad ways, it will be, or rather it is the advent.",
