    "    Hello everyone, welcome back to the computer networks course. Today we will see the classification of computer networks. \n",

    "    we will also understand what are the devices that are involved in LAN, MAN and WAN. And we will also understand what \n",
    "    are the new trends in computer networks. Computer networks are classified into Local Area Network or simply LAN, \n",
    "    Metropolitan Area Network or simply MAN, Wide Area Network or simply WAN. We will see Local Area Network first. \n",
    "    As the name implies, Local means it is restricted to a limited area. That is, a small network is said to be a local \n",
    "    area network. A Local Area Network is a computer network that interconnects computers within a limited area. Say a \n",
    "    small network that is there in our residence, or a school, lab, university campus or office is said to be a Local \n",
    "    Area Network. Let's take an example. Let there be hundred computers in a network. And this is a school network. Each \n",
    "    of these computers are connected to each other with the help of a switch. And we can call this computer network as \n",
    "    a Local Area Network. Why because, all these computers can communicate with each other internally. We can setup LAN \n",
    "    in two ways: one is a wired LAN and another one is a wireless LAN. In wired LAN we have cables. So the example \n",
    "    technology for a wired LAN is ethernet. We have already seen in the previous lecture that, ethernet is used to connect \n",
    "    two or more nodes. In this case, this node is connected to the switch, this computer is connected to the switch with \n",
    "    the help of an ethernet cable. To be precise, this is an ethernet straight-through cable because ethernet straight \n",
    "    through cable connects devices of different kinds. Switch and computers are different kinds of devices. So we need \n",
    "    to use ethernet straight-through cable. In case, if we want to connect this computer with this computer directly, \n",
    "    then we have to go for ethernet crossover cable. Whatever it is, ethernet is the well known and the most popular \n",
